    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>Tuft is an HTTP/2 web framework for Node.js that has been designed to provide excellent routing performance,
      even when serving thousands of routes, while maintaining minimal overhead. While it keeps its feature set to a
      minimum, it provides mechanisms to extend its functionality so that it can be adapted to almost any need.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>Tuft was built with the primary objective of becoming a viable HTTP/2 framework for Node.js. Specifically, it has
      been built to utilize Node's <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http2.html#http2_core_api"
        target="_blank">core HTTP/2 API</a>. Not all of the most commonly used frameworks support HTTP/2, and the ones
      that do tend to treat it like a second-class citizen by only supporting it via Node's <a
        href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http2.html#http2_compatibility_api" target="_blank">compatibility
        API</a>.</p>
    <p>HTTP/2 provides a significant performance increase over HTTP/1, and we are now at a stage where all major web
      browsers support it. Some of its benefits include:</p>

    <ul class="docs-list">
      <li>Minimal overhead via efficient HTTP header compression with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7541"
          target="_blank">HPACK</a>.</li>
      <li>Reduced latency via full request/response multiplexing.</li>
      <li>Increased security by favoring binary transmission over text.</li>
      <li>Server push (<em>this feature has not yet been implemented in Tuft, it's on the to-do list!</em>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of the above is possible while maintaining the core concepts of HTTP, including URIs, status codes, and
      request methods.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>When?</h2>
    <p>Development of Tuft in its first incarnation started in early 2019 as a part-time project to familiarize myself
      with the inner workings of Node.js. It has evolved a lot since then, but it is still untested software.</p>
