    <h1>Application</h1>
    <p>Many popular frameworks have a function as a default export that, when called, returns an object that is
      considered to be the "application". After adding routes, handlers, etc., the user is able to start a server by
      calling a method such as <code class="code-inline">.listen()</code> or <code class="code-inline">.start()</code>.
    </p>

    <p>In Tuft, the functionalty of this single "application" object is split into the following two objects:</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1. Route Map</h3>
    <p>This is an instance of <a href="/docs/tuft-route-map">TuftRouteMap</a>, which is returned by the framework's default exported function, and inherits from the JavaScript <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map"
        target="_blank">Map</a> object. It stores routes and their associated response data as key/value pairs, where
      the key is a string that consists of the request method and path concatenated together separated by a space (such as <code
        class="code-inline">'GET /foo'</code>), or just the path (to add a route for all supported methods) and the value is an object that contains the response data.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">const app = tuft()

app.set('GET /foo', {
  text: 'Hello, world!'
})

const myRoute = app.get('GET /foo')

console.log(myRoute)

// {
//   response: {
//     text: 'Hello, world!'
//   }
// }</code></pre>
    <br>
    <h3>2. Server</h3>
    <p>Once all the routes have been added to the route map, a server object can be created by calling the <code
        class="code-inline">.createServer()</code> or <code class="code-inline">.createSecureServer()</code> methods. When either of these methods is called, the data from the
      route map is compiled and made available to the returned instance of <a
        href="/docs/tuft-server">TuftServer</a> or <a href="/docs/tuft-secure-server">TuftSecureServer</a>. The
      server can then be started by calling the <code class="code-inline">.start()</code> method.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">const server = app.createServer()

async function startServer() {
  await server.start()
  console.log('Server has started.')
}</code></pre>
