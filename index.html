      <h2>Speedy</h2>
      <p>Tuft is an HTTP/2-only framework built around Node's <a
          href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http2.html#http2_core_api" target="_blank">core HTTP/2 API</a>,
        which gives it a performance advantage over other frameworks that rely on Node's <a
          href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http2.html#http2_compatibility_api"
          target="_blank">compatibility API</a>.</p>

      <h2>Minimalist</h2>
      <p>Routing is baked into the core functionality, but many other features commonly found in other
        route-based frameworks are intentionally not included, which results in minimal overhead.</p>

    <div class="feature-text-container three">
      <h2>Scalable</h2>
      <p>Tuft's routing algorithm has a timing complexity of O(1), so it will continue to serve requests at lightning
        fast speed, even with thousands of routes.</p>

    <div class="feature-text-container four">
      <h2>Extensible</h2>
      <p>Add the required functionality to your server only as needed. Utilize Tuft's built-in extensions or write your
        own, and optionally make them available to other developers.</p>
