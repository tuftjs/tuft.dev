    <h2>Speedy</h2>
    <p>Tuft is an HTTP/2-only framework built around Node's <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http2.html#http2_core_api" target="_blank">core HTTP/2 API</a>, which gives it a performance advantage over other frameworks that rely on Node's <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http2.html#http2_compatibility_api" target="_blank">compatibility API</a>.</p>

    <h2>Minimalist</h2>
    <p>A basic Tuft server is dependency-free, and only comes with a small set of features to keep things lean. Routing is baked into the core functionalty, but most other features that are commonly found in other route-based frameworks are intentionally not included, which results in minimal overhead.</p>

  <div id="feature-text-3" class="feature-text">
    <h2>Scalable</h2>
    <p>Tuft's routing algorithm has a timing complexity of O(1), so it will continue to serve requests at lightning fast speed no matter how many routes you add.</p>

    <h2>Extensible</h2>
    <p>Add the required functionalty to your server only as needed. Features like request body parsing and response body streaming are packaged as separate extensions within Tuft's base installation. You can also create your own extensions, and optionally make them available to other developers.</p>
